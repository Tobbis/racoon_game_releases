# Racoon Game

This repository contains release binaries for Racoon Game.

To run an AI agent, first start the AI controller with:
```bash
python ai_controller_fast_action_v0.3.py 5000
```

The `5000` value is the port. To use a different port, update `game_config.json`. 
The location of `game_config.json` depends on your operating system.

Then manually start the Racoon Game application.
